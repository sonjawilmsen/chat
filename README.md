# React based on Api.


The project is a web based chat function. This was made during the 6th week of the Codaisseur program. We followed the instructions of our teacher to create our own version of the app. The front end was build with React. It uses an API to communicate with the Back End.
It was very cool to see more on working with API's! 
It is still a work in progress.
